;; Loop until drawing-finished

;; Temperature?
;; Dealing with snags?
;; Allow deletion of *drawn* "structures"?


;; Initial codelets:
;;  Space finders, drawers, adorners

;; Find space
;; Find interesting figures to relate to
;; Add "system" to figure
;; Maybe start non-overlapping figure
;; Maybe start overlapping figure
;; Maybe start adornments on figure
;; Maybe start figure relating to figure
;; a grid or mirror or radial or other compositional arrangement
;; Maybe stop new figure generation, removing all possible figure generators
;; maybe start generating skeleton
;; Maybe add skeleton line according to notes on skeleton, or maybe change
;; Maybe mark skeleton as finished
;; Maybe start drawing
;; Maybe set ground colour
;; Maybe set figure colour
;; Maybe identify position for new figure based on existing figures
;; Maybe check to see if drawing is finished
;; &c

;; Codelets can post another codelet(s), remove codelets, add notes
;; create skeletons, draw outlines or fills, add other structures

;; The drawing can have skeletons, fills, outlines, negative space, 
;; compositional guides, potential places for figures, and so on as objects
;; It is the workspace


;; -->
;; Grid of coarse cells, or grid of points to start expanding a hull at?
