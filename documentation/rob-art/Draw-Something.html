<h2 class="chapter">Draw Something</h2>

<p>Draw Something generates simple line drawings. It does this by generating a set or random points, finding their convex hull (smallest enclosing shape), and drawing around that. These stages are a very simple analogue to observational or constructive drawing.

<h3 class="section">Precedents</h3>

<p>I was inspired to start on draw-something (and rheart as a whole) by Harold Cohen's program AARON. Ed Burton's ROSE and Kazushi Mukaiyuma's Shizuka, both also inspired by AARON, were influences as well.

<h3 class="section">Running Draw Something</h3>

<p>To run ae, change to the directory rheart/draw-something and run the file run.lisp there.<br>
<pre class="example">     $ cd draw-something
     $ openmcl --load run.lisp
     </pre>

   <p>Draw Something will print messages describing its progress then write the files debug.ps and image.ps in its directory. image.ps is the finished drawing.

   <p>You can open both files with a PostScript viewer such as GhostView, MacOSX Preview can also open PostScript files.

<h3 class="section">A Sample Session</h3>

<pre class="example">     cd draw-something
     openmcl --load run.lisp
