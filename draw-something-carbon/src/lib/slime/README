Overview.
----------------------------------------

  SLIME is the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs. It is
  implemented in two main parts: the Emacs Lisp side (slime.el), and
  the support library for the Common Lisp (swank.lisp and swank-*.lisp)

  For a real description, see the commentary in slime.el.

Quick setup instructions
------------------------

  In Emacs Lisp:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/the/path/to/this/directory")
    (require 'slime)
    (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (slime-mode t)))
    (add-hook 'inferior-lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (inferior-slime-mode t)))

  Make sure your `inferior-lisp-program' is set to a compatible
  version of Lisp. For CMUCL we currently require version 18e or
  later. For SBCL we require the "sb-introspect" contrib, for which
  you need 0.8.5 or later.

  Use `M-x' slime to fire up and connect to an inferior Lisp.

  Open a lisp-mode file and do `C-h m' to see the mode description.

  If you have bad luck, you may checkout a copy of SLIME that is
  completely broken, depending on what's happening in CVS at the
  time. To avoid this you can checkout from the CVS tag
  `FAIRLY-STABLE' like this:

      cvs <options> checkout -r FAIRLY-STABLE slime

Licence.
----------------------------------------

  The Emacs Lisp code is licensed under the GNU GPL to fit in with Emacs.

  The CMUCL and SBCL code is placed in the public domain to fit in
  with CMUCL and SBCL.

  The OpenMCL code is LLGPLed, just like OpenMCL.
